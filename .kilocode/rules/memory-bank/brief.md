This project involves building a Python-based application for research purposes, utilizing the TensorFlow library to develop a time series model for predicting photovoltaic (PV) power output. The system will incorporate comprehensive data preprocessing techniques tailored to our custom dataset. It will also implement a well-established time series architecture—such as LSTM, GRU, or Transformer-based models—using TensorFlow to ensure robust and accurate predictions. The goal is to create a scalable and reproducible framework that supports experimentation and performance evaluation in renewable energy forecasting. Save all code (\*.py) in @\src folder and all test in @\tests folder. When test python program using tf-intel-env environment which it created using conda. don't use unicode icon in all src file.
