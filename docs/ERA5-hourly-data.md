# ERA5 hourly data on pressure levels from 1940 to present
## from [https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/reanalysis-era5-pressure-levels?tab=overview)

From the [ERA5 data documentation](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation), the dataset variables you mentioned — `cc`, `r`, `q`, `t`, `u`, `v` — refer to specific atmospheric parameters commonly used in climate and weather modeling. Here's what each of them represents: [\[confluence.ecmwf.int\]](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation)

*   **cc**: *Cloud cover* — typically expressed as a fraction (0 to 1) indicating the proportion of the sky covered by clouds.
*   **r**: *Relative humidity* — the ratio of the actual water vapor pressure to the saturation vapor pressure, expressed as a percentage.
*   **q**: *Specific humidity* — the mass of water vapor per unit mass of moist air (usually in kg/kg).
*   **t**: *Temperature* — air temperature, usually in Kelvin.
*   **u**: *Zonal wind component* — the east-west component of wind speed (positive values indicate wind from west to east).
*   **v**: *Meridional wind component* — the north-south component of wind speed (positive values indicate wind from south to north).

These variables are available at various vertical levels (e.g., pressure levels, model levels) and temporal resolutions (e.g., hourly, monthly) depending on the dataset configuration.

Would you like help retrieving these variables from the Climate Data Store (CDS) or visualizing them for a specific region or time period?
